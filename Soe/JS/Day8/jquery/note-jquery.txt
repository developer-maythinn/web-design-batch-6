Basic syntax
$(selector).action()

A $ sign to define/access jQuery
A (selector) to "query (or find)" HTML elements
A jQuery action() to be performed on the element(s)


$(document).ready(function(){

});

Use inside a document ready event.
This is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).
